## Event-driven programming

### 1. 
Write jQuery parser for the entries on arxiv (title, authors, abstract, journal, submission date) for any given paper, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13859

Remarks/hints:

* the best approach is to download the web page locally and then add jquery to the html's header (use the same link as from example html pages)
* after adding jQuery one can add jQuery instructions to the end of the html to parse the web page 

### 2. 
Write a To-do application in html using jQuery. The application should have a few buttons like "Add", "Remove", "Mark as done". Use jQuery to manipulate html.
