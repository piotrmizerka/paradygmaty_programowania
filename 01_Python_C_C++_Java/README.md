1. Write a Python, C/C++ and Java programs and check whether it is a prime number of not.

Remark 1: There are some algorithms which can simplify this task, like Miller–Rabin. Please, do not use them. The goal is to compare the code from different programming paradigms.

Remark 2: Please, do not use external libraries.

2. Using a graphical debugger is crucial in programming. Use graphical debugger to stop your program in the exact moment when the code finds out whether the given number is indeed prime or not.

3. Finish this classes by writing the check for the very big numbers (100 digits and more) using Miller–Rabin alorithm (or any other) to find out whether the number is prime or not. You can use either of the languages from: Python, C/C++, and Java.
